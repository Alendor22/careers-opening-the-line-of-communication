# Opening the Line of Communication 

**Scenario 1:** You just met a developer who works at a company that’s hiring. 

**Scenario 2:** Your best friend introduces you to her friend over email. Your friend says you and her friend should meet for coffee but doesn’t specify why.

**Scenario 3:** You have a cousin who only knows you in the context of big family dinners but he happens to work at a big tech company. You’ve never before spoken to him about work stuff.

What you ultimately want out of the above situations is a referral, a connection to an internal recruiter at a company, or other job-related favor. But you can’t just dive in and ask for that. 

In this lesson we are going to show you how to open the line of communication which is the first step in starting a relationship to get you there. We’ll specifically talk about emails and what makes them effective, with examples of both good and bad ones. 

## The Ask 

The goal of this communication is to schedule a phone call or in-person meeting. **That’s it.** Don’t ask for a gazillion things in this email. Rather, there should be one core “ask”. 

Marketers often use the term “CTA”. Or, “call-to-action”. Essentially it’s one main action you want the audience to take. It has been found that when you give people too many options, they are far less likely to choose any. (A phenomenon known as the paradox of choice.)

In this scenario your audience is the email recipient. And the action you want them to take is scheduling a time to talk on the phone or meet with you in-person. When sending your message, you must make it clear that this is what you want.

## What Makes an Effective Email 

The goal is to catch the person’s attention, and make it easy for them to respond to you. Remember, the person you’re reaching out to may get lots of emails every day. You must give the recipient a reason to want to meet with you or connect on the phone. This means your email should be succinct, demonstrate your interest in them/their company, have one ask, and be respectful of their time. 

If possible, you should try to make a personal connection between you and the recipient. Maybe you met at a Ruby on Rails Meetup a few days before. Maybe you both grew up outside of Philadelphia. Or perhaps you both love Yoga. Or you’re related. Finding a mutual connection/interest to reference may mean you have to go out of your way to do some background research. However, that kind of personal touch will help you stand out in a sea of emails. 

Below are the key components of what makes a great email. You can use this as a checklist every time you send out a message asking for a phone chat or meeting. 

1. The email is friendly in nature 
2. Your message is custom to the recipient (it’s not a copy and paste template)  
3. You clearly state who you are 
4. The email clarifies why you’re reaching out 
5. You display interest in their industry, job, project, or company (no need to go overboard, but give a solid reason why you’re interested) 
6. There is a specific ask (phone call or meeting in-person)
7. You thank them (be appreciative of them taking the time to read your message!) 

## Good Email Examples

Below is an example of a good email. 

>Hi Katie,

>I recently graduated from The Flatiron School as a Full Stack Developer. I'm very intrigued by Company X. It’s astonishing how you are able to measure 7 billion daily interactions across all the social platforms. 

>It looks like you’re mainly recruiting for senior-level backend devs right now, so I was curious as to whether perhaps a more junior role might be coming up in the future, or even an internship. Might you have just a few minutes next week to talk about what it’s like to work at Company X?

>Attached are a few code snippets I wrote recently for a project called AdjustAList.

>Thanks, and hope to hear from you soon!

>Vanessa

This message clearly states who the sender is, why they’re contacting the recipient, displays their interest in the company, has one specific ask, and even includes some code snippets from a project. 

Here’s another good example. 

>Hi Jason,

>It was great to meet you at the NYC.rb meetup last night. Thank you for your enthusiasm for my karaoke app — I had a great time talking with you about your dream music apps.

>I'm in school through the end of next week, but would love to meet and talk sometime soon. Do you have any time late next week? I'd love to hear what you are most excited about regarding the future of Company X, and to get your perspective on what it’s like to work at such a fast growing company. 

>Looking forward to speaking more!

>Vanessa

This message reminds the recipient of who they are, references a specific part of the conversation they shared, has a clear ask (with a suggested timeframe), and it reiterates interest in the recipient's company. 

## Bad Email Examples

Below is an example of a bad email. 

>Jason, 

>I enjoyed speaking with you at the meet up yesterday. I'd love to find out more about your team and to tell you more about myself.

>Please let me know if you have time to meet/talk sometime.

>Thanks

>Cynthia

Unlike the good message examples above, this one is lacking. It doesn’t clearly state who the sender is. It also doesn’t display interest. And while it does have an ask, it’s not very specific. Overall, the message looks like the sender didn’t give it much thought. 

Here is another ineffective email example 

>Hello. My name is Sarah Dressler.

>I looked through the information on your website and am very interested in your internship program. I noticed the 2016 Software Engineer posting on your job website which also peaked my interest. Is this related to the training program?

>I would be interested to meet with you at some point if your interested.

>Thank you

>Cynthia

This email has a few problems. The sender does not clearly say who they are. Nor does it make any kind of personal connection to the recipient. The other issue is that the main “ask” is about a training program—not about meeting in person. The sender then closes the email by casually suggesting to meet in person. There are also glaring grammatical errors and inappropriate punctuation. Overall, this message fails to give the recipient a reason to want to connect with the sender. 

## Approaching People You Know Versus People You Don't Know

Before sending your email, hopefully you’ve already spoken to the person—in-person or online. If the recipient already knows who you are, it makes asking for their time much easier and increases the likelihood that they’ll say “yes”.
However, cold emails can still be effective. If you’re sending a cold reach-out email, here are a few additional things to keep in mind:

1. **The person is targeted** - For instance, they work at the company you’d like to work for. Maybe they even work in HR at the company you’d like to work for. Basically, it’s not just some random person you found on Twitter.

2. **Why you’re reaching out** - You give a good reason as to why you’re reaching out to them.

3. **Try to make it personal** - When reaching out cold, finding a connection point is what can make you stand out from the rest. Like, “We’re both friends with so and so” or “We’ve both worked at X company in the past” or “We both have given talks at the X Meetup”.

4. **You’re relevant** - If you’re reaching out regarding a specific opening, make sure it’s one you’re qualified for. Otherwise, you’ll lose credibility.

## On Following Up 

If you send one email and the person doesn’t respond, it’s a good idea to follow up seven days later. In a future lesson we go over the specifics for effective follow up emails. If you still don’t get a response after two emails, move on. 

## Great! Now You Have a Meeting

Sending out emails that receive responses can take some trial and error. Even if you follow all the suggestions to a T, not everyone will agree to grab a coffee, or even respond to your message. Remember, it’s like a sales funnel. And out all the people you contact, only a certain percentage will say “yes”. (Which is why it’s important to reach out to as many people as possible!) 

However, for those that do say “yes”, you just landed yourself an informal meeting. And the next lesson will discuss what you must do before, during, and after the meeting.  

## Assignment- Opening the Line of Communication

Create a Google doc. Title it ""Your Name" + Opening the Line of Communication."

Remember the three scenarios that we started this lesson off with? In this assignment, you will write appropriate opening emails for each of those scenarios. As a refresher, here they are again:

Scenario 1: You just met a developer who works at a company that’s hiring. 

Scenario 2: Your best friend introduces you to her friend over email. Your friend says you and her friend should meet for coffee but doesn’t specify why.

Scenario 3: You have a cousin who only knows you in the context of big family dinners but he happens to work at a big tech company. You’ve never before spoken to him about work stuff.

Copy and paste these scenarios in your Google doc, and below each one, write the email you would send to that person. 

**Email** your assignment to your coach. You'll be assigned a coach once you're through ~75% of the full stack web track so if you don't have a coach now, just keep learning to code and we'll get you set up with one when we feel you're ready to focus on career preparation in addition to technical curriculum. Once you have a coach, you can start submitting assignments.

Remember in the subject line to include your name and this specific assignment.

In this case, your email subject line will be “”Your Name” + Opening the Line of Communication”

In the body of your email again include:
>Your Name

>Assignment Title

>Your City, State

>Url to this specific Google document
